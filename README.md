# Azure Honeynet Project: Simulating Real-World Cyber Attacks
![Cloud Honeynet / SOC](https://i.imgur.com/S6whvfs.png)

## Introduction
This project will consists of creating my very own honeynet on Microsoft Azure that will entice attackers, log and monitor malicious traffic generated from these attacks, perform incident response, and implement hardening controls to secure the enivronment.  

## Objectives
The main objective of this project is to create a honeynet that will allow me to analyze live cyberattacks, conduct incident response and investigate event alerts, study attackers to understand their intentions, tactics, techniques, and procedures.  The second objective is to transform the unsecure environment into a secure environment by re-configuring the firewall, NGS, implementing Azure Private Links, and administering regulatory compliance, such as, NIST 800-53, PCI DSS. CIS, and Microsoft Defender for Cloud recommendations.  

Lets go on a journey together to turn the unsecure environment into a secure environment.
